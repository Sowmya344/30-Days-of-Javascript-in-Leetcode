# 30-Days-of-Javascript-in-Leetcode
I am learning Javascript and taken this to learn JS for front end. This is like a journal for me but feel free to use the answers in this repo. Thank you so much for using my answers!ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡

# Day-01:
Hello World Function:
What I learnt was in case of functions, always use "return" in it, and not "console.log" to print the result
## Why?
return "Hello World": 	Returns the string to the caller 

console.log("Hello World") : Prints to the console	


# Day-02:
Closure: A closure is when a function "remembers" the variables from its outer scope, even after the outer function has finished executing.
